See the @font-face declaration in server/public/css/calendar.css for list of fonts that need to be available in this folder.

So far it's DIN Regular and DIN Condensed only. And as the Condensed variant is used only for the large digits, it doesn't need to contain any other glyphs than numerals.


The fonts here were downloaded from these sources:

 - D-DIN-BOLD.otf, D-DIN.otf, D-DINCondensed.otf
   https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/d-din (ASCII and basic accents only)

 - 651-font.otf
   https://cs.fontsisland.com/font/din-pro (full Czech set of characters)
